# Credits

Special thanks to [Alfonso Garcia-Caro](https://github.com/alfonsogarciacaro), the auther himself of the Fable compiler for his awesome work on Fable and for being open and for helping me add reflection features to Fable which make the implementation of the library possible in the first place on the client.  

Many many thanks to [Diego Esmerio](https://github.com/Nhowka) for his awesome work on implementing these features: 
 - Uniform API for the library across the server and the client,
 - Support for multi-argument remoting functions
 - Contexual injection for reading the request context
 - Using plain `Async<'T>` in the definition of the functions
 - many others...
