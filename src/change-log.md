# Change Log

### July 2018 (See [PR](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/pull/58))

 - Major infrastructure rewrite and improvements to Reflection code [#55](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/issues/55)
 - Checking whether the protocol definition is valid [#56](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/issues/56)
 - Run everywhere as [Asp.NET Core Middleware](aspnet-core.md) (closes [#19](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/issues/19) and [#20](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/issues/20))
 - Handle `GET` along with `POST` for remote functions that don't require input, i.e. functions of type `Async<'t>` or `unit -> Async<'t>` can be invoked using `GET` requests. 
 - Remote functions of a single paramter of type `'a -> Async<'b>` don't require the request body to be an array of arguments, instead, you can send just the JSON object that can be deserialized to `'a`. This is not applicable to functions where `'a` is an array or list, fallback to a list of arguments is used.
 - Removed the `contextual` remoting handler [#50](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/issues/50) Use `fromContext` function thatS let you [gain access to the HttpContext](request-context.md). 
 - Localized error handling for Fable client: no more global error handlers [#59](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/issues/59) 
 - Using `ProxyRequestException` for [error handling](error-handling.md) that will give you access to the response when errors occur both for .NET and Fable client 
 - Added docs for [Integration Testing](dotnet-integration-tests.md)
 - Removed a lot of the functionality from the Fable client proxy [#61](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting/issues/61) 
 - Added `reader` monad as shorthand for constructing values using `fromContext` (docs TBA)
 - Initial dependency injection support for Suave (docs TBA)
